<!-- TODO:

  1) fix description at bottom of homepage
  2) make more adaptable to multiple minigames?
  3) write code that will ask the user at the bottom of the game box which
     option they choose, and will go to another (appropriate?) page when clicked
      form?
      buttons?
      form where two buttons are submit buttons with different actions?
  4) when wrong, have box pop up that displays game over message
     and asks user to enter their name
  5) create streak tracker
  6) display leaderboard
